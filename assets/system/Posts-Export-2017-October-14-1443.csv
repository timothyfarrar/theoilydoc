<em>""The Go-Giver</em> tells the story of an ambitious young man named Joe who yearns for success. Joe is a true go-getter, though sometimes he feels as if the harder and faster he works, the further away his goals seem to be. And so one day, desperate to land a key sale at the end of a bad quarter, he seeks advice from the enigmatic Pindar, a legendary consultant referred to by his many devotees simply as the Chairman.

Over the next week, Pindar introduces Joe to a series of “go-givers:” a restaurateur, a CEO, a financial adviser, a real estate broker, and the “Connector,” who brought them all together. Pindar’s friends share with Joe the Five Laws of Stratospheric Success and teach him how to open himself up to the power of giving.

Joe learns that changing his focus from getting to giving—putting others’ interests first and continually adding value to their lives—ultimately leads to unexpected returns.

Imparted with wit and grace, <em>The Go-Giver</em> is a heartwarming and inspiring tale that brings new relevance to the old proverb “Give and you shall receive.”

<img class=""size-medium wp-image-1658 alignright"" src=""http://theoilydoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/0f3bcb8-300x259.jpg"" alt=""0f3bcb8"" width=""300"" height=""259"" />

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We've all heard of him.  We've seen the sketchy posters strewn about the carnival grounds speaking of the 'amazing one man orchestra', or 'World’s Most Valued Musical Talent!"". Maybe you've been to see him.  Maybe you've just checked him out while you got a little of your YouTube on while you tried to absorb yourself into the couch just to escape the sounds of 3 children screaming for a snack (great parenting, BTW...j/k, we've all been there).  The thing is....at least last time I checked, this 'musical great' didn't have a Billboard Hot 100 hit to his name.  Not a solitary single on the radio.  Not even cracking the oh so generous 'adult contemporary' charts (if such a thing </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">actually</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> exists).  No.  This is just your run of the mill, wannabe jack of all trades...it's not Prince, Elton John, not even T.Swift.  Nope.  Those are talents right there.  And you know what else?  Those are people with a FOCUS, with a VISION, with their own unique SOUND.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So at this point you might be thinking, what the hey-yo am I reading again?  Sit back, relax. There is a point, and I'm just about to get to it.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So the premise here isn't to make yourself into a musician, or to expose the inner talent you've been hiding from the world all these years - save for the time you were bellowing out Katy Perry's best ballad in a shower serenade and then found out your spouse still hadn't left for work yet. (Yes, I know about that...sadly.  Snapchat be droppin truths that day.)</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The REAL point here is that we should take this ""one man band"" as an example, an analogy for our life - and ultimately our business mindset.  So many times we try to take on so many things and wear so many hats that in the end, everything gets lost in the shuffle and nothing really gets accomplished.  We get halfway there on 50 things, but all the way there on none.  We do this because we love to help others, want to be successful, and are trying REALLY hard, but yet, in the end, we can't sever seem to make things work out.  Instead of pleasing everyone, we end up pleasing nobody and barely scraping by.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So what does this MEAN, and how can we take steps to fix this?  Really, it's only natural for many of us to want to ""do more"" in life, whether it be related to family, friends, or a business/career.  But are we making the most effective use of our time?  Or are we getting caught up in minutiae and spinning our wheels, but not making a lot of progress?  Well, you’re in luck, because I'm going to teach you a method of organization and compartmentalization/task management that both behavioral psychologists and motivational influencers such as Tony Robbins share as a key tool in their teaching methods. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since this is a post about building your doTerra business, we will point our focus in that direction.  Let's first take an assessment.  Think about what you do throughout the day, week, and month.  Where do you spend your time as it relates to the doTerra?  try to picture WHERE the time is going, and the estimate how much time you might realistically have in a day, week, or month.  </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now, change things up a bit.  Think about what you actually accomplish in a typical month.  Do you have things that still linger on your To Do list?  Do you feel like you get a few of the ""musts"" done but none of the 'need to do' or 'like to do's'?  Maybe you teach that class that was scheduled but don't get to some of the follow ups, emails, or phone calls.  How can you possibly do more in the same amount of time?</span>

The answer lies not in how to get more done in the same amount of time, but rather in prioritizing what needs to get done first, and also grouping related tasks together so you can get a clearer vision of what you really WANT out of these tasks and what actually <em>needs</em> to get done out of your list.

The RPM (Rapid Planning) Method:

From Tony Robbins:

""RPM is a system of thinking, not a time management system. The goal in life is not to manage time, but creating a life that is absolutely fulfilling, a life that is always growing and contributing. This system may, in the beginning, seem like more work. However, after you train enough, the doing will come faster than before and you’ll get ten times the results. After completing the exercises in this workbook, you can take any vision and turn it into reality by recognizing and using the resources inside of you.""

Lets look at the acronym which further breaks down the process:

R: Results oriented:  First off what do you really WANT?  Or rather, what are the RESULTS you are looking for?  Is is to reach a certain rank? Enroll a set number of people per month?  Hold a set number of classes?  Having a clear and defined result in mind helps you develop a plan of action that specifically facilitates meeting that goal.  Think about this and write it down either on a notepad or print off the workbook from the link below.  It has been well documented how it is important to write down your goal and look at it often, so be sure to review not only your goal(s) but your action plan as well.

P: Purpose Driven:  To fully succeed you need to have a real, meaningful <em>purpose</em> to drive you.  This can't simply be something that is simply a 'nice to have' ideal, it has to be something meaningful to you.  If we attach meaning and purpose to our actions and goals, we are exponentially more likely to follow through and accomplish them, as it becomes not just completing a task, but contributing to a real mission, a <em>purpose.  </em>Try to use trigger words that will further motivate you when crafting your purpose statement, write down not just the WHY, but things that excite you to reach your goals (your WHAT), is it to be looked to as an expert or resource on essential oils to those on your team?  Is it to finally be financially independent, debt free, or have financial freedom from the traditional 9-5 lifestyle?  Whatever it is that comes to mind, write these key phrases down under your purpose, and then try to make a purpose or mission statement that incorporates your WHAT, or main goal, with your WHY, your purpose that drives you to reach this.

M: Massive Action Plan:  How are you going to get there?  You have your goals, you have your purpose, now how are we going to do this?  There is one key thing that I want you to realize, and that is simply this: if you only have a 'plan A' you probably won't reach your goals.  Think about the most successful people you know either personally, professionally, or simply are aware of that are leaders in society.  One common thread is that for virtually all of them, the path to success was not <em>easy</em>.  On your way to becoming successful, even in a small way or with a small goal, you have to expect that you will encounter setbacks, that you will experience some adversity.  Maybe you get sick, or your child gets sick and you have to care for them during the week you were planning on holding a class or writing a blog post.  Maybe you are working on a project for you job that takes most of your free time during the month, or maybe you have a commitment with the church, children's sports, etc.  The point, is that you will ALWAYS have something come up that will try to drive you away from accomplishing your goals.  This is not to say that you don't take time for yourself or your child when you are feeling ill, or that you ignore a work or community group project that is due.  Instead, this is to highlight the need for PERSISTENCE, the common thread for most leaders is not that they simply experienced adversity or setback, its what they did when they experienced these things.  They were still able to prioritize and keep a focus on their goals even when life got in the way or threw them a curveball.  Maybe they made up the time working late, maybe they simply prioritized what was truly important to them, but the key point is that you must not only prioritize, but also <em>persevere</em>.   This is why you need a <em>massive</em> action plan, something that says, even if plan A, plan B, plan C, etc fail, I'm still going to go after this goal, because it is important, it has a <em>purpose</em> to me.  So, think about how you would accomplish your goal(s), write down some ideas, then start to craft them into strategies, and be sure to think of several alternative ways to get to a goal (maybe its moving a class date, or holding a class online, prerecorded, etc. just think of the alternatives), and be sure to keep this a fluid list, so you can add new ideas as they come to you and scratch off strategies that may not be working at least for the time being.

Finally, lets break down how this method can help you prioritize things in your life:

Step 1: Capture.

This is quite simple, what you need to do is to <em>capture</em> what needs done in your life.  This works best if you can keep all the things you need to capture (ie your 'to do's') in ONE PLACE.  Maybe it is the notepad on your phone, or a physical note card, etc.  but the more organized you are with this, the less mental space your to do list will take up and simply by having everything in one place and writing new items down when they come up will make you stress level drop and your efficiency rise.  Its a know fact that humans can only focus on a handful (5-7) things at once, so the more you can direct your focus on big picture things (ie you write down the small tasks so you don't have to keep thinking about them until its time to get them done).  So try to get a list together of everything you can think of that needs accomplished and write it down in one place.

Step 2: Chunking

From this list we can then start to group things into categories, or 'chunks', so then instead of focusing on numerous small tasks, we can focus on a handful of big picture items.  Maybe you have written down things like ""clean the bathroom"", ""fold laundry"", and ""complete child's project"", ""Help with schoolwork"".  Once you have a list of several things, start to think about how these items relate to each other.  For example, when looking at the things provided in the sentence above, maybe you have 5-10 things that have to do with the 'house being clean' and then 4-5 things that have to do with the 'kids schoolwork'.  Write down these big picture categories and then place below it, in order of importance, the individual items that need done that relate to that category.  Now take the big picture things and focus on which ones are of greatest importance to you and your goals - and sure, there will be must do's like picking the children up from school that may not play into a big personal goal or business goal, there always will be things that have to get done, but this system will help you focus on what to do with your time outside of the must do's so you don't end up spending your day folding towels when you could be holding a class, mentoring others, or teaching your children.

Step 3: Action

This falls into the 'Massive Action Plan', and is simply a reiteration of that, you are just trying to find a way to get your 'big picture' stuff done, and the rest can wait and get done as needed.  Even if small tasks or unforeseen things get in your way, having a plan and some alternative routes to reaching a goal is paramount to getting it accomplished.

&nbsp;

In review:
<ol>
 	<li>Write down your goals (your WHAT/Result(s)) and review daily</li>
 	<li>Write down your WHY/Purpose and how it plays into your goal</li>
 	<li>Make a list of all you need to do, prioritize it with the chunking method</li>
 	<li>Make a Massive Action Plan to get the most important 'Big Picture' items done on your list, and be sure to have persistence/perseverance, knowing that you may have setbacks along the way</li>
</ol>
We hope this helps you not only do more in your doTerra business, but also to get more out of life, become less stressed and more fulfilled!

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Let’s first learn about the plant and some history:  Cinnamon Bark has been used as a spice and in traditional medicine for several centuries across numerous cultures.  In Ayurvedic medicine it is considered a remedy for respiratory, gynecological, and digestive ailments.  The oil is obtained from the inner bark of tropical evergreen trees of the genus cinnamomum, which have varieties that produce both the Zeylanicum (CZ) and Cassia (CC) cinnamon variations.  If the oil is obtained from the root skin/bark, leaves, or any other part of the plant other than the inner bark, it will have a different composition of chemical compounds.  Cinnamaldehyde primarily is sourced from the bark, while eugenol is primarily found in the leaves, and camphor in the roots.  So </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">where</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> the oil is sourced from in the plant is very important.</span>

<b>Chemistry: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> How can we distinguish Cinnamon Bark, Cinnamomum zeylanicum (CZ), from Cinnamomum Aromaticum (Cassia) (CC)?  First, just from the chemical composition, the Cassia form has a much higher content of coumarins, a family of compounds known to inhibit clotting, and can possibly cause (reversible) liver damage in large quantities.  This is why in Germany there are limitations on how much Cassia content may be allowed in food products, the threshold is set on a level low enough that consuming foods flavored with Cassia would not pose a risk to most people consuming typical amounts/serving sizes.  Second, we can see from the chemistry that a typical CZ profile has three main components, which represent over 80% of the yield/oil content.  The components are Trans-cinnamaldehyde (which is the largest/most prevalent at typically 50-60% of the total), eugenol, and linalool.  From here we can see the reference ‘Trans’, referring to what in chemistry we call an </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">enantiomer</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.  Imagine a chemical molecule as being represented by your right and left hands, in a </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">synthetic</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> mixture you would get an even proportion of both the ‘right hand’ and ‘left hand’ versions, and we call that a racemic mixture, or 50:50 of each enantiomer.  Now in nature, organisms, such as this cinnamon plant have very specific ways of making a molecule so that they produce only one form of it, and this is one of the ways we can tell if a cinnamon bark essential oil contains synthetic cinnamaldehyde.  Additionally, the presence of any adulterants, or a chemical composition that varies a great amount from the components and percentages previously stated (ie if the essential oil in question has less than approximately 50% trans-cinnamaldehyde, then it might </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">smell</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> like cinnamon bark, and may even have some of the beneficial effects, but it won’t be pure cinnamon bark, and at that point you have to question what synthetics or adulterants have been added as ‘fillers’ and whether that is healthy for you to inhale, ingest, or apply topically to your body.  Most of the time these chemical compounds won’t be disclosed, so that is why you want to make sure you know the quality and purity of the essential oil you are using and what company you are purchasing from, as many of these ‘filler’ compounds could have adverse effects if used on/in/near the body - especially in larger quantities.  However, with purely distilled essential oil, especially one that has a GCMS data sheet to provide proof of purity and content, we can be assured that we know exactly what we are using on our bodies.</span>

<b>Evidence:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Now that we have the very basics of the chemistry out of the way, let’s look into some of the supporting literature on what CZ can be used for, see the attached article for a meta analysis of much of the available literature:</span>

<b>Antimicrobial/Antibacterial/Antifungal Use</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are numerous studies pinpointing that Cinnamon Bark has at least moderate to strong inhibitory/killing effects to some of the most common bacteria and fungi.  Some examples are noted here, with some of the more notable being MRSA, C. Diff, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Salmonella, E. Coli, and various Streptococcus species. (Please see the references in the attached study/meta-analysis for further details)</span>

<b>Diabetes:</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Several studies quoted in the provided meta-analysis show that there are likely beneficial effects on glucose metabolism.  Ranasinghe, et al. and Bandara, et al., show that CZ, or cinnamon bark, can be useful for [1, 2]:</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">     -Reducing post-prandial intestinal glucose absorption by inhibition of enzymes alpha amylase and alpha               </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">glucosidase – both are drug targets and are involved in carbohydrate metabolism</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">     - Stimulation of cellular glucose uptake by membrane translocation of GLUT-4</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">     -Stimulating glucose metabolism and glycogen synthesis</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">     -inhibiting gluconeogenesis</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">     -Simulating insulin release and potentiation of insulin receptor activity</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">- In Vivo studies showed benefits such as:  1. Weight loss, 2. Reduction of Fasting Glucose, 3. Reduction in HbA1c, and 4. Increase in circulating insulin levels</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">(A simplified summary of all points will be included at the end of this article)</span>

<b>Cholesterol:</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">From Hasan, et al., we can see that several beneficial effects on blood lipids were seen [3]:</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">     -In animal studies, total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides were all reduced, while increasing HDL</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">     - However, animals given levels of typical dietary intake in humans did not correlate to significant lipid reduction.  – which may mean that supplementation with essential oils exceeding typical dietary consumption may be beneficial, though such a parameter has not been established</span>

<b>Blood Pressure:</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hasan, et al., also noted that there were positive effects on blood pressure in animal studies [3]:</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">     -Hypertensive rats experienced a significant drop in blood pressure following administration of CZ</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Also CZ has been noted to have positive effects in humans in several studies </span>

<strong>Other effects:</strong>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are noted antiparasitic, antioxidant, collagen formation(anti-aging of skin), and some positive neurological effects documented as well, this list is not meant to be comprehensive of every possible study or beneficial effect.  This should merely provide you with a scientific reference when questioned on the basis of any benefit you may be sharing with someone.</span>

<b>To summarize:</b>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In basic terms, what have we learned here?  We know that:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Studies have shown Cinnamon Bark is different than Cassia and synthetic cinnamon</span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The chemical makeup is <em>different</em> (60% </span><b>trans</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">-cinnamaldehyde; ~20% eugenol/linalool)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Studies have shown Cinnamon Bark can have antimicrobial/antibacterial/Antifungal</span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">CZ has proven studies showing effectiveness against common causes of bacterial and fungal infections</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Studies have shown Cinnamon Bark has shown benefit in Glucose metabolism/diabetes</span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Helps increase insulin supply and response (improves blood sugar metabolism)</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Helps decrease weight gain and decrease carbohydrate intake in the intestines</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Helps improve cellular uptake of glucose</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Helps reduce the body’s release of glucose and control fasting glucose levels</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lowers HbA1c – glycosylated hemoglobin, or red blood cells ‘marked’ with glucose molecules due to ‘prolonged exposure’ to high blood glucose levels – this is just a marker that shows that blood sugars have been uncontrolled for long periods (3+ months), lowering this marker means blood sugars are more under control/normalized</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Studies have shown Cinnamon Bark has benefits in lowering cholesterol</span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some animal studies noted a drop in Total cholesterol, LDL, triglyerides (‘bad lipids’) and increase in HDL (‘good lipids’)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Studies have shown Cinnamon Bark has shown promise in normalizing/lowering blood pressure</span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Animal studies showed a decrease in blood pressure from hypertensive  to normalized</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Studies have shown Cinnamon bark has numerous other effects that have been studied on a smaller scale/show promise</span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Antioxidant</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cellular regeneration/health</span></li>

When your PV reaches 125, doTERRA will send you the pre-selected product of the month. The higher the PV of each of your orders, the more chances you will have to qualify for the product of the month and any other promotions that doTERRA offers throughout the year.

2018,"Essential oils: Where emotions and chemistry collide","The emotional benefits of Essential Oils is something that is often times misunderstood, or ignored all together, because of the thought that it is ""junk science"". However, the chemistry behind emotions has been studied, and the affects of physiology acknowledged, for a long time.

In the blog post <a href=""https://doterra.com/US/en/blog/science-safety-physiology-emotional-aromatherapy-psychology-meets-chemistry"">Emotional Aromatherapy: Psychology meets Chemistry</a>,  Dr. Rodriguez discusses the physiological effect that the chemistry of essential oils has on the human body and, more specifically, on psychology. Rodriguez goes into the chemical constituents of a variety of oils. For example; Floral essential oils are high in monoterpene alcohols, which exhibit toning and calming properties. On the other end of the spectrum, mint oils are high in ketones, which are energizing and uplifting.

For more specific essential oil suggestions, and how to safely and effectively use them to effect your emotions, check out our podcast episode on <a href=""http://theoilydoc.com/essential-oils-emotions/"">Essential Oils and Emotions</a>.
